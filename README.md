# Mobile-Based-Human-Emotion-Detection-System-Using-Deep-Learning
# Facial Expression Recognition (FER) using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to recognize and classify facial emotions into seven categories: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, neutral, and fear. The implementation leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on the MobileNet V1 architecture to achieve this goal.

## Introduction
With the increasing integration of machines into various aspects of society, providing them with perception capabilities can significantly enhance their functionality. Machine perception enables machines to understand their environment and interact more effectively with humans. Recognizing facial emotions is a key aspect of this, as it helps machines understand human intentions and responses.

## Architecture
The FER system is implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the MobileNet V1 architecture. MobileNet V1 is chosen for its efficiency and ability to perform well on tasks with limited computational resources.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model includes images displaying seven facial expressions:
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Anger
- Surprise
- Disgust
- Neutral
- Fear

Each image is labeled with the corresponding facial expression, allowing the model to learn and differentiate between these emotions.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FER-CNN.git
    cd FER-CNN
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To train and test the model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and placed in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Results
The system achieved an accuracy of 70.89% in recognizing and classifying facial expressions. The performance can be further improved with more data and fine-tuning of the model parameters.
